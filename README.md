# SnacksApp

This project is a mobile application built using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) with .NET 8. The application allows users to browse, search, and purchase a variety of snacks via a clean and intuitive interface. It connects to a .NET 8 Web API (in a separate repository) for data retrieval, user authentication, and e-commerce functionality such as product listings, shopping cart management, and order processing.

This application was built following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ4k1IC8GhW03ALRg_UfZv1tOs-k_zri4">Youtube series .NET MAUI tutorial by Jose Macoratti</a>.
